# Welcome to IonQ's QML challenge, hosted by SKKU!

Image classification is an important task in the field of computer vision. Every year, researchers develop better and better models to obtain more accurate classifications on standardized benchmarks. Recently, quantum computing approaches have been proposed.

In this challenge you'll work like an IonQ Apps Team scientist to explore image classification using quantum machine learning (QML) methods.

We'll consider a binary classification problem and we challenge you to design a hybrid classical-quantum neural network with the highest possible classification accuracy. 

We've granted you *exclusive* access to unreleased features of IonQ's next-generation SDK to help you handle the orchestration and all the classical parts of the hybrid pipeline, so you can focus on the most interesting, and purely quantum aspects: 

- loading image data onto a quantum backend using encoding circuit, 
- distinguishing encoded state vectors using a trainable ansatz, and
- extracting useful features for classification by measuring a collection of observables.
